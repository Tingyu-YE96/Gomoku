# Group_D_Gomoku

## Project Statement
Gomoku, also called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board. It can be played using the 15×15 board or the 19×19 board. Players alternate turns to place a stone of their colour on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones.

## Basic Functions:
1.The main function is to achieve a two-player battle.

2.The board size should be 19*19. Each player will have different colored stones (for example player 1 will have black and player 2 will have white). After each move, the program will check if there is a winner or not.

3.When the five stones of the same player practice a straight line vertically or horizontally or diagonally, that player wins and then exits the game. You can exit the game at any time during the game.

## Further Functions:
1.Background music: The music will be background long music, that would be around 2 to 5 minutes. Also, we will try to add action sounds (SFX). These will give sound feedback when a player or machine plays a move and when a party wins the match.

2.Man-machine battle: The purpose of this mode's implementation is to have the player play with trained agent by implementing the reinforcement learning

## Requirements
1. Implement the basic logic of Gomoku and finish man-man game mode in the console without undo mode:
    i. A two array with 19 rows and 19 columns representing the 19*19 board with the default value of 0.
    ii. Update any array element by inputting the value (1 for black and -1 for white).
    iii. Once the array element is updated, restrict the array element to change for the whole game.
    iv. After every move, check if there are five stones in row vertically or horizontally or diagonally.
    v. If there are 5 stones in a row, end the game with the winner's name.
2. Build a graphic window using EasyX and design a good user interface.
3. Try to implement the undo feature.
4. Try to implement basic intelligent man-machine logic.
