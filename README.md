## Project Statement
Gomoku, also called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board. It can be played using the 15×15 board or the 19×19 board. Players alternate turns to place a stone of their colour on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones.
