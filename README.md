# Group_D_Gomoku

## Project Statement
Gomoku, also called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board. It can be played using the 15×15 board or the 19×19 board. Players alternate turns to place a stone of their colour on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones.

## Basic Functions:
1.The main function is to achieve a two-player battle.

2.The board size should be 19*19. Each player will have different colored stones (for example player 1 will have black and player 2 will have white). After each move, the program will check if there is a winner or not.

3.When the five stones of the same player practice a straight line vertically or horizontally or diagonally, that player wins and then exits the game. You can exit the game at any time during the game.

## Further Functions:
1.Background music: The music will be background long music, that would be around 2 to 5 minutes. Also, we will try to add action sounds (SFX). These will give sound feedback when a player or machine plays a move and when a party wins the match.

2.Man-machine battle: The purpose of this mode's implementation is to have the player play with trained agent by implementing the reinforcement learning
